Comparing lab 10 with lab 1

-  Feature IDE/Aspectj code is well managed than the original Gumball Machine simulation using Inheritance in Lab1. 

- The ability to debug the code is handled in a better way using Feature IDE/Aspectj than 
the original solution.

- In Feature IDE/Aspect solution the sequencing of the code events are simplified .

- The behaviour of the code can be easily changed at runtime by using Feature IDE/Aspectj programming.
